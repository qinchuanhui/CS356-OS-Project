The first line is a command-line input, then the ouput is following 

root@generic:/data/misc # ./BBC 20 4 
parameter number error!


root@generic:/data/misc # ./BBC 3ab 4 4 5
invalid char!


root@generic:/data/misc # ./BBC 41 0 23 1
Parameters should not be less than one!



The last line "user signal 1" means the process is finished after all the threads are killed or finished
Because I use rand( ) to set the threads, so there may be some special-look but right-logic results.


root@generic:/data/misc # ./BBC 3 4 10 4
