There are two folders and a report.
One folders is for basic requirement and the other one for bonus.
In the folder I also include a xx-modified.txt, which tells the changed parts in the kernel code.
As for other details, I think I make some explicit file-names and folder-names, so there is no need to explain too much.

Although I have submit the captures, I strongly suggest viewing the result through my report instead of the picutures only.

These codes can run smoothly on my computer, if there is some wrong, please contact me qinchuanhuiyulong@sjtu.edu.cn
